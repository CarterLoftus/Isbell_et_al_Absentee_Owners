# Isbell_et_al_Absentee_Owners
Contains all R code that accompanies the Isbell et al. manuscript titled: Absentee owners and overlapping home ranges in a territorial species

The file "publication_code.R" is sufficient to derive all R-based analyses in Isbell et al. "Absentee owners and overlapping home ranges in a territorial species" starting with the raw data. Access to the raw data can be granted upon request to Lynne Isbell (laisbell@ucdavis.edu).

I encourage others to use any pieces of this code that they may find useful. Current inefficiencies in the code will be eliminated upon publication of a package that is currently in prep. The package will be intended for the purpose of analyzing interactions between simultaneously tagged animals (but analyses are unlikely to be applicable to within-group interactions).

Please cite the code if and when you use it. Its DOI is: 10.5281/zenodo.4015395
